# OxfordETH
Repository for Oxford Hackathon

Welcome! We're a team of 3 hackers, 2 of which are focused on UI, presentation, research and ptiching and 1 of which is focused on software development.

We came up with the idea to create a tennis / racquet sport booking system leveraging flare's blockchain potential.

*****************************
QUICK READ:
  Set up a http server (frontend) & flask server (backend), use main.html as the index file.
  Parts of the website are not yet linked up due to extensive research having to be done on the backend instead.
  Feel free to play around and try different things.
  This project is still in its early stages, see our pitch, video and presentation in order to find out more about our direction of travel.

*****************************

We decided to leverage flare's blockchain potential to decentralise the booking process for raquet sports, away from costly platforms with horrendous fees, towards a more user <-> coach, relationship that requires GPS verification at the beginning of a game, and at the end, stored on the blockchain to avoid manipulation / mistrust.

Additionally, you may want to book a coach that is from / lives in a different country, this is why, for this reason and the other reasons such as decentralisation, we have decided to make the payment system use flare tokens as well.

The funds are 'held' until the coaching session has ended and been fully verified.

SETBACKS WE FACED:
*****************
Our team formation didn't happen until late Saturday morning due to an issue of one member (of an initial team of 2) unexpectedly leaving.
*
By the time we had finished finalising our plans and direction, we didn't start the main parts of development until early Saturday afternoon.
*
This project is still largely under development due to time constraints and a team refactoring situation that was beyond our control, so please look at our pitch presentation and direction as where we may have gone further if weren't to have said constraints.
*
In order to mitigate as much as this as possible,
**
We, reused elements of code from my previous team formation the night before.
**
Used tools such as telegram and OneNote to plan and organise ourselves.
**
Gave certain API key finding research to certain members and got them to explore different things we could do.

Thank you for reading our README, please let us know what you think by sending an email to: ethoxford2025groupjaa@gmail.com with any feedback you have!
*
Over the coming weeks within free time, we're considering furthering development of this project, to see if we can reach its full potential!
